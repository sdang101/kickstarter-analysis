### Challenge
Looking at the Outcomes Based on Goal for plays line graph, success rate is highest at 75.81% when the goal is less than 1,000 dollars and lowest at 0.0% when the goal is 45,000 to 49,999 dollars. There is a weak negative correlation between rate of success and goal amount; as goal amount increases the rate of success decreases.

Looking at percentage failed, the rate is lowest when the goal is less than 1,000 dollars (24.19%), and highest when the goal is greater than 45,000 to 49,999 dollars (100.0%). There is a weak positive correlation between rate of failure and goal amount; as the goal amount increases the percentage of success increases.

Looking at percentage canceled, it has a constant line at 0.0%.


Looking at the Outcomes Based on Launch Date for theaters, there are three peaks for months that have a successful outcomes: February (56), May (111), and October (65). February and October are local peaks while May is a global peak meaning May produces the most successful outcome. December is not a good month to launch with 35 failed outcomes and 37 successful outcomes, December has the worst outcome compared to other months. 

With these two graphs, it's evident to launch in May and to have a goal amount of less than 1,000 dollars to have a successful outcome. 

Though these two graphs don't show us much about whether the length of a caompaign contributes to its success or failure. It'll be useful to see whether the length from the launch date to the deadline is correlated to a successful outcome and the average amount a backer donates. Finding these outcomes will help us know how long to fundraise and the average amount a backer donates.

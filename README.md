### Challenge
Looking at the Outcomes Based on Goal for plays line graph, success rate is highest at 71.08% when the goal is less than 1,000 dollars and lowest at 16.37% when the goal is greater than 50,000 dollars. There is a weak negative correlation between rate of success and goal amount; as goal amount increase the rate of success decreases.

Looking at percentage failed, the rate is lowest when the goal is less than 1,000 dollars (24.94%), and highest when the goal is greater than 50,000 dollars (58.93%). There is a weak positive correlation between rate of failure and goal amount; as the goal amount increases the percentage of success increases.

Looking at percentage canceled, there is a moderately strong correlation between goal amount and percentage canceleds; as goal amount increases percentage canceled increases.


Looking at the Outcomes Based on Launch Date for theaters, there are three peaks for months that have a successful outcome: February (56), May (111), and October (65). February and October are local peaks while May is a global peak meaning May produces the most successful outcome. December is not a good month to launch with 35 failed outcomes and 37 successful outcomes, December has the worst outcome compared to other months. 

With these two graphs, it's evident to launch in May and to have a goal amount of less than 1,000 dollars to have a successful outcome. 

Though these two graphs don't show us much because it doesn't show us the optimate length to fundraise for each category and how much each backer donates for each category. It'll be useful to see whether the length from the launch to the deadline is correlated to a successful outcome and the average amount a backer donations according to each category. Finding this outcome will help us know how long to fundraise and the average amount a backer donations to each category, thus each category will know when to start a fundraiser and predict approximately how many more backers they need before the deadline and whether they are on track to reaching their goal.
